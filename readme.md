## Project Overview
The goal of this project is to classify galaxies based on their photometric properties using machine learning. The dataset is sourced from the **Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS)**, and the model is trained to predict whether a galaxy is **STARFORMING** or **STARBURST**.

---

## Features
- **Machine Learning Model**: A Random Forest Classifier trained on SDSS data.
- **Web Interface**: A Flask-based web application for making predictions.
- **Easy Setup**: Simple installation and setup process.
- **Scalable**: Can be extended to include more features or models.
